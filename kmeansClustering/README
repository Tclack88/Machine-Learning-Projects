The purpose of this is to use kmeans clustering to cluster countries based on similarities of the following criteria: 

Action taken on climate change
Better transport and roads
Support for people who can't work
Access to clean water and sanitation
Better healthcare
A good education
A responsive government we can trust
Phone and internet access
Reliable energy at home
Affordable and nutritious food
Protecting forests rivers and oceans
Protection against crime and violence
Political freedoms
Freedom from discrimination and persecution
Equality between men and women
Better job opportunities

These are specified in the file countries.csv



Program is written in Python2 and a test.py file is used to check it (the mean of the kmeans clustering methodology is in kmeans.py)
The program also outputs the sum of squared error an plots it after each iteration.
run it using 'python test.py'

Interesting to note that what we may consider 'first world countries' and 'third world countries' are clustered together here
